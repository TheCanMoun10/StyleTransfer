# VGIS_841_ImageSynthesis

## Style transfer
Ablation study performed using Pix2Pix and CycleGAN PyTorch implementation. Cloned from: https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
Added augmentations to the data loader to conduct image processing.

## Action localisation
Cloned from: https://github.com/wei-tim/YOWO
Trained using batch size 4 (low memory available) for 5 epochs.
